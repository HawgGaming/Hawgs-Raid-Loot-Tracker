# Hawgs-Raid-Loot-Tracker
On Stream Loot Tracker w/ Price Estimates (EFT)
Thanks for downloading my jank ass program!

I made this as an add on for streams, to show the audience what loot I found. 

I am not a developer, it was made with the help of AI. If you have any suggestions or want to help
with the project, hit me up on discord, hawg_gaming.

The green area is chromakeyed for stream visibility. Add an application capture on obs, then
use a chroma key filter to remove the green background. Volia, instant transparency for stream.

Settings can be changed for background color (not the chromakey), text size and color. If you cannot read the text on the buttons, change the text color.

There is a setting for pvp/pve pricing. Prices are pulled from Tarkov.Market. If you are missing the API, just use this: gkdPbO1cXthdlhu1

When hitting "end raid", it saves a screenshot of that into the "previous raids" tab, complete with a timestamp.

Enjoy! If you like the program, plz give me a shoutout. -Hawg
